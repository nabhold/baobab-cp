# Programme Gate P0 — Architecture Inventory and Lock

**Gate status:** PASSED
**Date:** 2026-09-13
**Authority:** `nabhold/baobab-cp` Tenant Onboarding & Provisioning Technical Specification (BCP-TS-ONBOARDING-001) §4–5, 87
**Method:** Direct inspection of `internal/store/postgres/migrations/000001`–`000032`, `internal/domain/*.go`, `internal/repository/postgres.go`, `internal/events/envelope.go`, cross-referenced against `docs/reconciliation/canonical-contract-matrix.md`, `shared-control-plane-audit.md`, `platform-resolution-spine-audit.md`, and `shared` ADR-SHARED-008. Nothing below is asserted from ADR prose alone where the migration or Go source could be read directly.

## 1. Why this document exists

The Technical Specification requires exactly one central Phase-0 Gate before any further schema work: a current-state inventory, a KEEP/REMODEL/SPLIT/MERGE/REMOVE classification for the 15 named platform objects, and five specific locks/decisions (§87). Three companion documents in `docs/reconciliation/` already did most of this inventory work as bug audits (dated 2026-09-08, predating the Technical Specification itself) and, in several cases, already **remediated** what they found against real PostgreSQL and a real `nabhold/shared` checkout — not just documented it. This document is the missing piece: it recasts those findings into the Technical Specification's own §5 deliverable format, extends coverage to the objects those audits did not examine (`CapabilityScope`, `CapabilityProvider`, `CapabilityGrant`, `MarketParticipation`, `ProvisioningState`, `ReadinessSnapshot`, `Drift` — all added to the schema after those audits were written), and formally closes the five-item Phase-0 checklist.

No object below is reclassified without a migration file or Go source citation. Where an existing reconciliation doc already established a finding, this document cites it rather than re-deriving it.

## 2. Phase-0 Classification Deliverable

| Object | Existing State | Target State | Classification | Migration Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Capability** | `capability.capability` (`000008`), extended with `status`/`domain_key`/`maturity` (`000024`, `000030`) | CapabilityDefinition runtime projection (ADR-BCP-003) | **KEEP** | None required. `domain_key` exists but is not yet validated against `shared`'s `namespace-registry.yaml` enum at write time — tracked as follow-up, not a P0 blocker. |
| **CapabilityBinding** | `capability.capability_binding` (`000012`), binding_mode locked to the canonical 5-value set and `provider_id` added (`000028`) | capability → provider → instance, per Technical Spec §16 | **REMODEL** (in progress) | Two items open, both already tracked (`#74`, `#76`/`#82`), neither blocks P0: (1) `provider_id` is nullable pending a provider-registration backfill workflow; (2) `scope_id` still references `mapping.mapping_scope`, not the new `capability.capability_scope` (`000029`) — Technical Spec §16's `capability_scope_id` field is not yet wired. |
| **Engine** | `topology.engine` (`000005`) | runtime technology family | **KEEP** | None. |
| **EngineInstance** | `topology.engine_instance` (`000005`) | concrete topology runtime | **KEEP** | None. |
| **Context** | `domain.ResolveContextRequest`/`ResolvedContext` (`internal/domain/context.go`); live `/v1/context/resolve` now runs end-to-end against a migrated schema (`shared-control-plane-audit.md` §12, `TestTenantLifecycleEndToEnd`) | resolved immutable context (ADR-BCP-004) | **REMODEL** (P0 runtime defect already fixed; richer model still open) | The P0 "non-functional against its own migrations" defect from `shared-control-plane-audit.md` §2.1 is fixed and verified. Still missing, per `platform-resolution-spine-audit.md` finding 6: Principal, Digital Estate, property/channel, deployment region, environment, isolation profile, authorization decision, immutable resolution time. Not a P0 blocker — resolution works and fails closed; it is materially incomplete for Programme Gate P5. |
| **MappingScope** | `mapping.mapping_scope` (`000009`) — 4 columns (`tenant_id`, `market_id`, `entity_type`, `scope_type`) | mapping-specific scope, ~18 dimensions per `canonical-mapping.schema.json` | **KEEP** (table identity), columns REMODEL | Expand columns before building real scope-precedence resolution — already flagged as P2 in `canonical-contract-matrix.md`. |
| **CapabilityScope** | `capability.capability_scope` (`000029`) — full dimension set (tenant, legal entity, organisation, business unit, digital estate/property, channel, market, jurisdiction, currency, customer segment, catalogue, operating/geographic region, deployment region, environment, isolation profile, include/exclude countries) | dedicated entitlement/binding scope, distinct from MappingScope (ADR-SHARED-007 §25) | **ADD — done** | None for the table itself. Not yet referenced by `capability_binding` or `tenant_capability` (deliberately deferred, `#74` — a real backfill/compatibility plan is needed before repointing). |
| **ProductSubscription** | `product_subscriptions` (`000019`, renumbered from the orphaned generation-A migration per `shared-control-plane-audit.md` §2.1) — `tenant_id`, `product_id`, `status` only | product-version subscription with `ProductVersion`/`CapabilityComposition` linkage, `SubscriptionProfile`, `EntitlementProjection` (Technical Spec §91) | **REMODEL** | This is the thinnest object in the inventory relative to its target state. No `ProductVersion`, composition, or entitlement-projection linkage exists yet. This is Programme Gate P4 scope, not a P0 blocker, but is flagged here as the single largest remaining gap in the classification. |
| **CapabilityProvider** | `capability.capability_provider` + `capability.provider_capability_support` (`000028`) | first-class provider (ADR-BCP-002 §5.3, ADR-BCP-006) | **ADD — done** | None. |
| **CapabilityGrant** | `capability.capability_grant` (`000029`) — provenance (`source`/`source_reference`), status, effective dating, revocation fields, matching `shared`'s `capabilityGrantSource`/`capabilityGrantStatus` enums | explicit entitlement (ADR-BCP-003 §9-19) | **ADD — done** | Additive: the legacy `capability.tenant_capability` boolean-enablement table (`000008`, still referenced by `000024`) is not yet retired. Migrating real entitlement onto `CapabilityGrant` and dropping `tenant_capability` is tracked separately (`#72`) and does not block P0. |
| **DigitalEstate** | `estate.digital_estate` (`000007`) — schema only, no Go code reads or writes it | capability consumer; per `shared` ADR-0001, estate ownership/metadata belongs to the estate's own repository, not `baobab-cp` | **KEEP** (as reference-only) | Confirm intended scope with an explicit ADR before building beyond a reference column — already flagged as P3 in `canonical-contract-matrix.md`. Do not build full estate metadata here. |
| **MarketParticipation** | `market.market_assignment` (`000006`) — `tenant_id` + `market_id` + effective dating only, **no capability dimension** | explicit footprint model: per-market `SOURCING`/`PROCUREMENT`/`SELLING`/`IMPORTING`/`EXPORTING`/`WAREHOUSING`/`DISTRIBUTION`/`FULFILMENT` flags (ADR-BCP-011, corrected per ADR-BCP-015 CR-006) | **REMODEL** | `market_assignment` proves a tenant may participate in a market at all, but cannot yet represent *what* it may do there — the entire point of ADR-BCP-011. Needs either new columns or a child table carrying the capability flags, keyed against the now-registered `market.*` capability domain (`shared` ADR-SHARED-008). Programme Gate P2/P3 scope. |
| **ProvisioningState** | `provisioning_operations` (`000019`) — `operation_id`, `tenant_id`, `idempotency_key`, `request_hash`, `state`, `revision` only | `TenantProvisioning` process aggregate: `product_requests[]`, `estate_requests[]`, `market_requests[]`, `current_phase`, `blocking_reasons[]`, `desired_state_version`/`observed_state_version` (Technical Spec §21-22) | **REMODEL** | `provisioning_operations` is an idempotency/replay-detection record, not a provisioning-orchestration aggregate. It should very likely become one of the inputs to the real `TenantProvisioning` table (Programme Gate P7), not be discarded — its idempotency-key uniqueness constraint is exactly the mechanism Technical Spec §108 requires. |
| **ReadinessSnapshot** | absent | readiness projection (hierarchical: Provider/Capability/Product/Estate/Tenant) | **ADD** | Not started. Programme Gate P10 scope. Not a P0 blocker — no other object depends on its existence yet. |
| **Drift** | absent | reconciliation drift (desired vs. observed state comparison) | **ADD** | Not started. Programme Gate P10 scope. Not a P0 blocker. Note: `tenants.desired_state`/`observed_state` (`000019`) are a primitive precursor at the tenant level only — real `Drift` needs to operate per-object, not just per-tenant. |

No object above is reclassified without evidence already cited. No later phase may silently reclassify one of these without an explicit architecture amendment, per Technical Specification §5.

## 3. Phase-0 Checklist — Five Required Locks/Decisions

### 3.1 Binding enum lock

**LOCKED — done.** `capability.capability_binding.binding_mode` is constrained to exactly `PRIMARY`, `FALLBACK`, `SHADOW`, `MIGRATION`, `DISABLED` (migration `000028`, `capability_binding_binding_mode_check`), with the superseded `SECONDARY`/`READ_ONLY`/`MIGRATION_SOURCE`/`MIGRATION_TARGET` values defensively remapped rather than assumed absent. This is CR-002 already implemented in the database, not merely decided in prose.

### 3.2 Binding model lock

**LOCKED — partially implemented.** `capability_binding.provider_id` exists (migration `000028`), giving the CR-005 shape (`Capability → CapabilityBinding → {provider_id → CapabilityProvider, engine_instance_id → EngineInstance}`) a real column on both sides. It is nullable pending a provider-registration backfill workflow (`#76`, `#82`) — this is a tracked, deliberate interim state, not an unlocked decision. The lock itself (both fields required in the target model) is not in question; only the backfill timeline is open.

### 3.3 Event vocabulary lock

**LOCKED — corrected.** The canonical event-type format is `com.nabhold.<context>.<...>.v<N>` (`nabhold/shared`'s `contracts/events/v1/envelope.schema.json`), which `internal/events` already constructs and which `TestRegisterTenantOutboxEventMatchesSharedSchema` verifies round-trips through real PostgreSQL and the real shared schema (`shared-control-plane-audit.md` §12). This repository's own Technical Specification (CR-003) had independently declared a different, incompatible format (`baobab.<bounded-context>.<aggregate>.<event>.v<major>`) that **no code in this repository ever actually implements** — the running system was already correct; only the Technical Specification's prose and the downstream ADR-BCP-015 were wrong. See `shared` ADR-SHARED-008 for the full resolution and the erratum recorded against the Technical Specification and ADR-BCP-015.

### 3.4 BCP-001 migration-count erratum

**RECORDED.** The Technical Specification's CR-004 already documents the erratum (17 vs. 18 migrations in ADR-BCP-001's original count). The point is moot in practice: the canonical migration set has since grown to 32 files (`000001`–`000032`), all correctly registered in `canonicalMigrationNames` — implementation tooling relies on the actual migration files, as CR-004 instructs, not on any prose count. This entry closes the checklist item; see §4 for where it is now durably logged.

### 3.5 Migration strategy decision

**DECIDED — extend forward, do not rewrite.** Technical Specification §19 left this an open choice pending repository state. In practice, every remediation applied since the `shared-control-plane-audit.md` baseline (migrations `000019`–`000032`) has extended the canonical sequence forward rather than rewriting `000001`–`000018`, consistent with `shared-control-plane-audit.md` §10 item 1's explicit choice of "the minimal-risk version of (a)." This document makes that de facto practice the formal Phase-0 decision: **`baobab-cp` extends its migration sequence forward; it does not rewrite already-applied canonical migrations**, for the remainder of the pre-production period Technical Specification §55 describes.

## 4. Governance record

These five decisions are logged in `docs/governance/decision_log.md` as of this document's acceptance, since the Technical Specification explicitly calls for the Phase-0 checklist to be recorded there and that file was previously empty.

---

## 5. Gate exit

Per Technical Specification §87, "No schema work proceeds before P0 passes." All five checklist items are locked or formally decided (§3), and every one of the 15 named objects has a real, evidenced classification (§2) with no unresolved KEEP/REMODEL/SPLIT/MERGE/REMOVE ambiguity — REMODEL and ADD items are legitimate, tracked future-phase work (Programme Gates P2–P10), not open P0 questions. **Gate P0 is PASSED.** Programme Gate P1 (Shared Contract Foundation) and beyond may proceed.
