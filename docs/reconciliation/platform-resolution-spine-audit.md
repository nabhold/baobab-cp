# Platform resolution spine: implementation baseline

**Date:** 2026-09-08  
**Authority:** `nabhold/baobab-cp` (runtime), `nabhold/shared` (contracts)  
**Repositories inspected:** `baobab-cp`, `shared`, `baobab-erp`, `baobab-trade`,
`baobab-pulse`

## Outcome

The repositories contain useful foundations, but the complete resolution spine is not
production-ready. The Control Plane already has the physical canonical tables, temporal
mapping and primary-binding constraints, resolver packages, RFC 9457 errors, OIDC
verification, contract checks and a transactional outbox. These are foundations to keep.

The current composed resolver is nevertheless unsafe for production: it accepts caller-
assembled candidate lists, hard-codes `baobab_trade`, resolves a mapping using the tenant
ID as the canonical entity ID, silently breaks equal-ranked ties, selects topology
independently of the chosen binding, and does not enforce temporal validity, Digital
Estate scope, instance isolation profile or authorization within the resolution decision.
These are P0/P1 correctness defects, not documentation gaps.

## Repository findings

| Repository | Existing strengths | Material gaps | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| `baobab-cp` | Go runtime; migrations 000001–000023; schema-qualified canonical registry, topology, capability and mapping tables; OIDC; outbox; repository and resolver layers | Runtime resolver types duplicate canonical concepts; request supplies candidate records; hard-coded capability; incomplete Context; ties do not fail closed; topology is not constrained to selected binding; no reverse-resolution/quarantine path; incomplete stable error taxonomy | P0/P1 |
| `shared` | Accepted Baobab ADRs; JSON Schema/OpenAPI/AsyncAPI assets; TypeScript context and mapping reference code | Reference resolver contains deferred engine/capability compatibility and risks becoming a second runtime authority; no complete shared schemas for the richer binding/instance/full-resolution response required by this programme | P1 |
| `baobab-erp` | iDempiere-only target, contract lock, conformance file, reconciliation and ERPNext-removal evidence; local validation passes | Must consume resolved Context, instance and mappings as contracts; must not accept tenant/native identity from untrusted headers; end-to-end Control Plane contract scenario is absent | P1 |
| `baobab-trade` | Mature tenant/estate tests, ERP projection and mapping client tests, production-control evidence | One unrelated PR (#45) is open; full trusted resolution-envelope consumption and version compatibility across the new spine remain to be proven | P1 |
| `baobab-pulse` | Haystack/Qdrant architecture, migrations and contract fixtures | Supplier-research routing is not proven through a capability binding without exposing pipeline IDs; Control Plane contract version lock/e2e acceptance is incomplete | P1 |

## Confirmed Control Plane defects

1. `internal/resolver/pipeline.go` hard-codes capability key `baobab_trade`; callers cannot
   request `erp.sales-accounting`, `intelligence.supplier-research`, or future capabilities.
2. The pipeline passes `req.TenantID` as `CanonicalEntityID`. Tenant and canonical entity
   are explicitly distinct identities.
3. Capability and mapping resolvers sort deterministic tie-breaker IDs and choose one.
   Equal effective precedence must instead return an ambiguity error.
4. `CapabilityBinding` has no effective interval in the Go resolver model and its resolver
   does not evaluate `effective_from`/`effective_to` or scope compatibility.
5. The topology resolver may return any active instance in the supplied slice; it does not
   require the instance selected by the binding and has no health, draining, residency or
   isolation-profile eligibility decision.
6. Context omits Principal, Digital Estate, property/channel, deployment region,
   environment, isolation profile, authorization decision and immutable resolution time.
7. The handler accepts mappings, bindings and engine instances in the request payload.
   A consumer can therefore influence routing state that must come from authoritative
   Control Plane repositories.
8. Forward mapping scope is inferred by comparing one `scope_id` string independently
   with tenant/legal-entity/market/country values. It does not load and evaluate the
   multi-dimensional `MappingScope` record.
9. No reverse mapping service quarantines unresolved engine events.
10. Resolver errors are plain strings. They cannot reliably drive RFC 9457 codes,
    retryability, metrics or operator diagnostics.

## Existing invariants to preserve

- Existing canonical UUIDs and temporal history must never be regenerated.
- `Tenant`, `LegalEntity`, `DigitalEstate`, `Market`, jurisdiction and deployment region
  remain distinct.
- PostgreSQL exclusion constraints remain the last line of defence against overlapping
  active authoritative mappings/bindings.
- `nabhold/shared` owns wire contracts; `baobab-cp` owns resolution behaviour and state.
- Peer engines use authenticated APIs/events and never query Control Plane tables.
- ERPNext references may remain only in historical migration evidence and prohibition
  tests; ERPNext must never be a live engine, binding or fallback.

## Remediation sequence and merge gates

| Gate | Change set | Exit evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Consolidate canonical Go model and shared wire schemas | No competing runtime model; schema/Go compatibility tests |
| 2 | Complete PostgreSQL status, scope, FK and temporal invariants | PostgreSQL 17 migration and concurrency tests |
| 3 | Trusted immutable Context and authorization linkage | spoofing, precedence and worker-propagation tests |
| 4 | Scoped temporal `CapabilityBinding` resolver | missing/ambiguous/inactive tests fail closed |
| 5 | Binding-constrained eligible `EngineInstance` selection | region, isolation, health, draining and retired tests |
| 6 | Forward and reverse Mapping resolution | temporal, ambiguity, cross-context and quarantine tests |
| 7 | Tenant/legal-entity/estate isolation | Zuribeans, Thamani and Nabhold negative tests |
| 8–9 | Instance relocation and capability extraction | stable canonical IDs and unchanged consumer contracts |
| 10 | Cross-repository contract compatibility | all lock files agree and compatibility CI passes |
| 11–14 | Performance, resilience, observability and security | measured report plus automated fitness tests |
| 15 | Production-readiness evidence | every control is PASS or explicitly BLOCKED |

## Validation baseline

- `baobab-erp/scripts/validate.sh`: **PASS** (51 tests plus JSON validation).
- Local `baobab-cp` validation: **environment blocked** because the execution image does
  not contain Go or Docker. GitHub Actions remains authoritative for this audit-only PR.
- Local `baobab-trade` validation: **dependency blocked** because node modules are not
  installed; existing open PR #45 is left untouched.
- Local `baobab-pulse` validation: **dependency blocked** because pytest is not installed.
- No open PR existed in `baobab-cp`, `shared`, `baobab-erp` or `baobab-pulse` at baseline.

## Decision

Proceed gate-by-gate. Do not expose or integrate the current composed `/v1/resolve`
behaviour as a production contract until Gates 1–7 pass. Each gate must include code,
negative tests, contract/migration evidence where applicable, and an updated conformance
record. A green unit-test suite alone is insufficient evidence of readiness.
